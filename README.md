# Word problem for hyperbolic groups in CUDA
A CUDA implementation of the NC^2-algorithm for the word problem in hyperbolic groups.
The algorithm was described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/129712.129723).

## Things to implement
- [x] General multiplier
- [ ] Geodesic concatenator
- [ ] Improved FSA parser

## Things to do
- [ ] Test multiplier on really large inputs
